//! Worker sync operations for job attachments (future implementation).
//!
//! This module will provide worker-side sync operations:
//! - `sync_inputs` - Download job inputs to worker session directory
//! - `sync_outputs` - Upload job outputs from worker session directory

// Placeholder for future implementation.
// See design/job-submission.md for planned API.
